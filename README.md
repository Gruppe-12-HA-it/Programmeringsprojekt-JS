Welcome to our programming project!
We're a group of students from CBS. We're coding a project in Javascript.

We're aiming for it to be the following:
- a quiz/test setup website, which recommends users an idea for a bachelor degree based on their answers in the quiz.
- A login system, so the user can log back in and see his previous results. This way, the user doesn't have to take the quiz every time he logs in.
- a "contact-us" page, where users would be able to reach us on email, by filling out a form.


Contribution-rules for the team:
- Don't push anything into the master-folder. 
Instead, create a branch with your name, and push it to there. When the group meets again, we'll merge the code into the master code.
- Don't do anything you don't know what does. If you're unsure of what you're doing in your terminal, etc., contact the rest of the group first.
- Keep a backup of the latest code you changed. If anything goes wrong with a merge, a backup is nice.



Usage:
- Open the html-file in a browser, preferably Chrome. From here, you'll be able to navigate to different subpages, including a login-page,
the quiz page, a contact-page, and a browse all data on bachelors page. To use the quiz, it's recommended that you sign up first. 
After signing up/login in, go to the quiz and answer. After answering, the code will figure out a somewhat accurate match on bachelor-degrees
at CBS, based on the answers you gave in the quiz.
